ByteCompressor
==============

	Scala abstractions for some compression algorithms.

	Beside abstraction layer, this project provide some useful utils for data processing, 
	like Pipe, ByteBufferBackedInputStream and ByteBufferBackedOutputStream.

ByteCompressor: Huffman Coding
==============================

	Avast fork of https://github.com/nayuki/Huffman-Coding , it ads bytecompressor layer compatibility.

	This project is an open-source reference implementation of Huffman coding in Java.
	The code is intended to be used for study, and as a solid basis for modification
	and extension. As such, it is optimized for clear logic and low complexity,
	not speed/memory/performance.


	Description
	-----------

	An overview of the code is given here: [http://nayuki.eigenstate.org/page/huffman-coding-java](http://nayuki.eigenstate.org/page/huffman-coding-java)

ByteCompressor: jSnappy
=======================

	Java impmenentation of compression algorithm Snappy from Google. 
	This is a Avast a.s. fork of http://code.google.com/p/jsnappy/ , 
	it adds bytecompressor layer compatibility.

ByteCompressor: ZLIB
=======================

	Bytecompressor abstraction for Zlib and Gzip compression algorithm from standard Java package java.util.zip.

	Both the zlib and gzip formats use the same compressed data format internally, but have different headers
	and trailers around the compressed data.
